The TM Forum are considering 'Model-driven Onboarding of Phyisically Oriented Resources', see 
http://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/display/ODA/Model-driven+Onboarding+of+Phyisically+Oriented+Resources

This repo contains a proposed extension of RFC 8348 to hold information on possible
physical containment stuctures of a given device, for example what cards are allowed in a given slot of a chassis.

The project name comes from Wayang a form of puppet theatre art found in Indonsia (Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia 17 Feb 2018) and is used for its association with YANG and giving designers closer control. 

"With WAYANG you pull the strings"
